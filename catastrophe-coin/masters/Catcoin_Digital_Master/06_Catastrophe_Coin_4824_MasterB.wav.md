# Notes

I learned about Catastrophe Bonds, the bonds municipalities issue when Hurricane
season approaches.  These bonds can be tied to speculation devices - futures.
Their value is determined in the fine print and for poorer communities that lack
the systems to accurately account for a storm's damage, are very analogous to
betting on a boxer going down in the 4th.  If the storm is not quite that bad or
is too devastating the bonds don't help the issuers - sucks to be them.

So I invented but did not issue Cat Coin to play along!

Catastrophe Coin (CAT) is an Ethereum-based token designed to critique the
exploitative nature of catastrophe bonds and the speculative excesses of
cryptocurrencies. By tethering the token's value to a custom index of
catastrophe bonds, CAT exposes how these instruments systematically extract
value from vulnerable communities through flawed proxy measurements while
enriching Wall Street through disconnected parametric triggers.
