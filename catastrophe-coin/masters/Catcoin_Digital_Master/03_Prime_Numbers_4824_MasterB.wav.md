# Notes

I moved to the Santa Cruz Mountains during the 2008 financial crisis and
explored software on my own while under-employed.  One of the fascinating things
to catch my attention was crypto - I played with the mining code and did some
contract work for an exchange for 2 months.  I accidentally left 200 dollars in
my personal test account that years later financed some serious home
improvements. I've bemoaned "why oh why didn't I test with 2,000 dollars!".
