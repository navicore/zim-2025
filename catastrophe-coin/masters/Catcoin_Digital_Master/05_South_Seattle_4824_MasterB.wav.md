# Notes

I spent the last years of the 2010s living in peace in South Seattle until
"lockdown" happened in 2020.  I learned what a loud place the neighborhood was
being home all day for the first time.  I had fire engines and police cars going
by my apartment constantly and the glass in the pre-war window panes shook with
the deep base booming from boom cars waiting for the light on the corner to
change. When I ventured out for a motorcycle ride once I came across a dirty
Chevy Suburban with no license plates and tinted windows seemingly following me
though the low traffic streets.  It was a surreal post-apocalyptic time!
