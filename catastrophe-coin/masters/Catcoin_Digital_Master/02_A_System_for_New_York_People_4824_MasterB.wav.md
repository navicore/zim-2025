# Notes

Some of the people I knew in the 90s went from dot-com stocks to art to real
estate and never felt the pain of the financial crashes.  But then they learned
about Bernie M and the pyramid.  My favorite quote from an investor that got
wiped out in that scheme was "I just thought there was a system for New York
people".
