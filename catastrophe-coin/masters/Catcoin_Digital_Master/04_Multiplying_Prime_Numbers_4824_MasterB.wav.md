# Notes

The early days of the cloud, the emergence of concentrated social media, the
anger over 2008, all combined in mostly ugly ways throughout the 2010s - crypto,
gamergate, anti-vax, the US election, culminating in mass death and the total
collapse of all "News" media as any kind of check on right and wrong.
