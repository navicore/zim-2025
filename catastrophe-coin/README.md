Track Notes
========

A System for New York People
----------

* Play some jazz chords in the ipad to start - Autumn in New York kind of stuff
* Themes: Comfortable, Naive, Happy, then Bewildered

Prime Numbers
----------

Multiplying Prime Numbers
----------

200 Dollars
----------

* fun but ending in mixed emotions - wistful regret, then end in anger

South Seattle
----------

* Make is chaotic and stupid

Catastrophe Coin
----------

* Make it scary

The Compound
----------

* Play some rippling piano warm up finger drumming notes in the ipad to start - dramatic but familiar
* the body should not be lmost a drone - a bit rhythmic might be ok for familiar
  but the point is more a bunch of sketches as we tour the compound.
* Imagine communism masquerading as feudalism w/ no kings or warlords
* Themes: Familiar, Safe, Aware, Happy, at Peace - home
