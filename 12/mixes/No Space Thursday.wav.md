# Notes

The Prism Circuits Quasar and TKB playing through Qu-Bit Data Bender and
probably some pedals.  Different sections of different recordings arranged in
Live to play one at a time with space between them.

The experiment was to play with using CMD-e and drag to add space - success!
But also some of the space comes from starting the next clip after a small
amount of silence in the arrangement view.
