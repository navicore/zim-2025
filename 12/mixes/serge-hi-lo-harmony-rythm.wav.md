# Notes

This is sequenced with the 4-step sequencer and clock divider and random stepped
CV from SSG(GTO).  The single voice is two GTSs normaled to a Peak/Trough with
some CV modulated by a self-modulating wave multiplayer bottom two circuits.

Prepared to discuss harmony with Sarah.  This is a single voice but the harmony
on odd notes hold my attention.
